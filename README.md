## Recommendations
Self inc has already rolled out additional product offerings including a secured credit card that can be established with the money you saved up while paying off the secured loan debt.  I believe that an area of opportunity for Self inc is to also create a way to build business credit. Right now Self inc serveices only applies to individual credit, but buy creating a new solutions that reports building business credit it can tap into another major demographic in the American entreprenuer landscape. Nav.com is a fintech company that offers business credit services, Self inc has a link that refers to Nav for individuls interested in business credit, the nav website was more complex and complicated. If Self inc can recreate a simple approach to business credit it can retain current customers looking for those service and potentially increase its business and profits.
